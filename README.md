### Instagram User Analytics

**Introduction**:

**Business Problem:** [Instagram User Analytics](https://github.com/shauryananda/Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/SQL/Instagram%20User%20Analytics.pdf)

You're a data analyst working with the product team at Instagram. Your role involves analyzing user interactions and engagement with the Instagram app to provide valuable insights that can help the business grow.

User analysis involves tracking how users engage with a digital product, such as a software application or a mobile app. The insights derived from this analysis can be used by various teams within the business. For example, the marketing team might use these insights to launch a new campaign, the product team might use them to decide on new features to build, and the development team might use them to improve the overall user experience.

In this project, I have used SQL and MySQL Workbench as your tool to analyze Instagram user data and answer questions posed by the management team. Your insights will help the product manager and the rest of the team make informed decisions about the future direction of the Instagram app.

### Operations & Metric Analytics

**Introduction**:

**Business Problem:** [Operations & Metric Analytics](https://github.com/shauryananda/Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/SQL/Operations%20And%20Metric%20Analytics.pdf)

Operational Analytics is a crucial process that involves analyzing a company's end-to-end operations. This analysis helps identify areas for improvement within the company. As a Data Analyst, you'll work closely with various teams, such as operations, support, and marketing, helping them derive valuable insights from the data they collect.

One of the key aspects of Operational Analytics is investigating metric spikes. This involves understanding and explaining sudden changes in key metrics, such as a dip in daily user engagement or a drop in sales. As a Data Analyst, you'll need to answer these questions daily, making it crucial to understand how to investigate these metric spikes.

In this project, my goal is to use advanced SQL skills to analyze the data and provide valuable insights that can help improve the company's operations and understand sudden changes in key metrics.

**SQL Queries:**
